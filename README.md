# 🔐 Web Security Analyzer Tool

A Python-based automated Website Security Analysis Tool developed using Flask that evaluates the security posture of websites by performing multiple security checks and vulnerability analysis.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **Web Security Analyzer Tool** is designed to analyze websites and identify common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. The system performs automated security analysis and generates a website safety score based on detected risks.

The tool integrates multiple cybersecurity modules including:

* SSL Certificate Verification
* Open Port Scanning
* Security Header Analysis
* SQL Injection Detection
* XSS Detection
* Subdomain Enumeration
* WHOIS Lookup
* Website Safety Score Calculation
* PDF Report Generation

This project was developed as a **Minor Project** for the degree of **M.Sc. Cyber Security** at **Amity University Rajasthan**.

cd web-security-analyzer-tool
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 📊 Working of the System

1. User enters a website URL.
2. Flask backend processes the request.
3. Security modules perform analysis.
4. Data is collected from:

   * HTTP Response Headers
   * SSL Certificate
   * Network Ports
   * DNS & WHOIS Databases
5. Vulnerabilities and risks are identified.
6. Safety score is calculated.
7. Results are displayed on dashboard.
8. PDF security report can be downloaded.

---

# 🔍 Safety Score Logic

The tool uses a rule-based scoring mechanism.

```text
Initial Score = 100%

- Open Ports → Deduction
- Missing Security Headers → Deduction
- SQL Injection Risk → Deduction
- XSS Vulnerability → Deduction

Final Score = Website Safety Percentage
```
